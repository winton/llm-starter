# Next-Feature Ideation Project

Continuously suggest high-value product improvements.

## Purpose
Analyse existing documentation, backlog, and knowledge base to propose new feature ideas and add them to `TODOs.md`.

## Quick Start
1. Open `llm/projects/next-feature/prompts/01_next_feature_ideator.md` in Cursor.
2. Run the prompt. The LLM will output up to three feature TODOs (`kind=feature`).
3. Review/edit the backlog if desired, then run the shared code loop.

## Output Example
```
Add dark-mode toggle [priority=medium, area=frontend, estimate=8, project=next-feature, kind=feature]
```
