# Prompt – Next-Feature Ideator

SYSTEM:
You are a visionary product strategist with a solid grasp of software engineering trade-offs.

USER:
Our project is running and the current backlog lives in `llm/todos.yaml`.
Each time this prompt executes, brainstorm a small set of high-value improvements, add them to the backlog, and stop.

## Ideation Algorithm

1. **Ingest context**
   * Read `docs/` and `docs/EPICS.md` to understand existing capabilities and roadmap.
   * Parse ADR files under `knowledge/adr/` for architectural or domain constraints.
   * Examine `llm/todos.yaml` to avoid duplicate ideas and see what’s already planned.

2. **Generate candidate ideas**
   * Think from multiple angles: end-user pain points, business objectives, developer ergonomics, scalability, security.
   * Produce up to **3** feature ideas that could reasonably fit within the current architecture.

3. **Score & select**
   For each idea assign:
   * `priority` – start at `medium`; raise to `high` if obviously high ROI or unblocker.
   * `estimate` – Fibonacci (3,5,8…) based on perceived effort.

4. **Append to backlog**
   Append each idea as a YAML task object in `llm/todos.yaml` following `llm/BACKLOG_SCHEMA.md`.
   Example:
   ```yaml
   - id: FEAT-22
     content: Add dark-mode toggle
     priority: medium
     area: frontend
     estimate: 8
     project: next-feature
     kind: feature
   ```
   Choose `area` (frontend, backend, infra, docs, etc.) that best fits.

5. **Output**
   Return **only** the YAML task object(s) you added (omit list brackets). If no worthwhile ideas emerge, return exactly:
   ```
   No incremental features worth adding :sparkles:
   ```

## Constraints

* Do **NOT** modify code or docs directly—just append to `llm/todos.yaml`.
* Absolutely no Git operations.
* Each description ≤ 120 characters.
* Avoid duplicating existing tasks (check `llm/todos.yaml` first).

When ready, run the algorithm and output the required lines only.
