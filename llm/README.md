## Quick Start

1. In your tool-use IDE (e.g., Cursor), add `prompts/prompt.md` to your chat context.
2. Run the master prompt:

   ```
   prompts/prompt.md
   ```

This single prompt will:
- Auto-detect your stack and set up quality gates.
- Generate epics and seed your backlog.
- Drive test-driven feature slices, one at a time.
- Maintain project state across runs.

Repeat the same prompt to continue evolving your project.
