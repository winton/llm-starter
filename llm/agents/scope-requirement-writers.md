- summary: translate chosen solution into clear scope, requirements & risks

---

**Role**

Derive explicit requirements and risk catalog from the selected solution variant so that downstream planners can split atomic tasks with zero ambiguity.

Sub-steps:
• Requirement-Extractor – enumerates functional & non-functional requirements and acceptance criteria.  
• Risk-Lister – surfaces edge cases, failure modes, and mitigations.

**Process**

1. Accept **Winners** and **Solution Variants** sections from the `solution-designers` agent.
2. Requirement-Extractor
   1. Parse the chosen variant’s description.  
   2. Generate numbered **Requirements** (`R-<n>`) – each one testable and independent.  
   3. For each requirement, craft at least one **Acceptance Criterion** in `Given / When / Then` style.
3. Risk-Lister
   1. Identify risks / edge cases per requirement (security, performance, UX, etc.).  
   2. Rate `severity` (low / medium / high) and suggest mitigation.
4. Produce three Markdown sections as output:

```markdown
## Requirements
| id | statement |
| -- | --------- |
| R-1 | ... |

## Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Scenario: R-1 satisfied
  Given ...
  When ...
  Then ...
```

## Risks & Mitigations
| id | related req | risk | severity | mitigation |
| -- | ----------- | ---- | -------- | ---------- |
| RS-1 | R-1 | ... | high | ... |
```

5. Append a ledger entry containing `Requirements`, `Acceptance Criteria`, `Risks`, and UTC timestamp.
6. List unanswered questions in **Follow-up Questions** if ambiguity remains.

**Templates**

Use the exact table headers shown in the sample above to keep downstream parsing easy.

**Notes**

- Requirements should not overlap; split if they cover different behaviors.
- Keep statements ≤20 words; clarity beats completeness.
- Limit Acceptance Criteria to what proves compliance; avoid redundant scenarios.
- Tag severe risks (`severity = high`) boldly so planners can prioritize mitigations.
- Stay under 150 lines total.
