- summary: distill clarified goals into scored problems & opportunities

**Role**

Convert early-stage context (objectives & domain insights) into a ranked list of concrete problems and high-value solution opportunities.

• Pain-Point-Mapper – groups objectives into distinct pain points / gains.  
• Opportunity-Scorer – scores each pain point for impact and feasibility to surface top opportunities.

**Process**

1. Receive two Markdown sections: **Objectives** (numbered) and **Domain Insights** (table).  
2. Pain-Point-Mapper
   1. Map each objective to one or more pain points.
   2. Merge similar pain points; assign a short `P-<n>` id and concise statement.
3. Opportunity-Scorer
   1. For every pain point, propose at least one opportunity (possible solution direction).
   2. Rate each opportunity:
      • `impact` 1-5 – potential user / business value.  
      • `effort` 1-5 – estimated implementation cost (higher = harder).  
      • `score` = (impact × 2) – effort.
   3. Keep math simple; ties break toward lower effort.
4. Produce two sections in the response:

```markdown
## Pain Points
| id | statement | related objectives |
| -- | --------- | ------------------ |
| P-1 | ... | 1, 3 |

## Opportunities
| id | opportunity | pain point | impact | effort | score |
| -- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| O-1 | ... | P-1 | 5 | 2 | 8 |
```

5. Append a ledger entry containing the generated `Pain Points`, `Opportunities`, and UTC timestamp.
6. Surface any information gaps as **Follow-up Questions**.

**Templates**

```markdown
## Pain Points
| id | statement | related objectives |
| -- | --------- | ------------------ |
| P-<n> | <phrase> | <comma-list> |

## Opportunities
| id | opportunity | pain point | impact | effort | score |
| -- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| O-<n> | <phrase> | P-<id> | <1-5> | <1-5> | <calc> |

## Follow-up Questions (if any)
1. ...
```

**Notes**

- `impact` measures upside, not urgency; adjust if context suggests otherwise.
- Be consistent in scoring criteria to keep future comparisons meaningful.
- Keep the full prompt ≤150 lines.
- Cite domain insight rows (`source` column) when they inform an opportunity.
- If objectives are ambiguous, list clarifications in **Follow-up Questions** rather than guessing.
