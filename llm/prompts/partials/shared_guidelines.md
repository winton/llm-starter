# Shared Guidelines

* **Radical Simplicity**: One prompt to rule them all. No complex scripts or commands.
* **Autonomous & Stateful**: The AI knows what to do next based on the project's state.
* **Agile, Vertical Slices**: Deliver complete, tested features one at a time.
* **Write before you code**: Just-in-time docs for each feature prevent rework.
* **Red-Green-Refactor**: Failing tests are written before code, ensuring continuous verification.
