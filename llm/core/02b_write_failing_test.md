# Prompt 02b â€“ Write Failing Test

SYSTEM:
You are a senior full-stack engineer who is an expert in Test-Driven Development (TDD). Your job is to write a single, focused test case that fails until the required feature is implemented.

USER:
You have been given the ID of a task from `llm/todos.yaml`. The ID is: **{{TASK_ID}}**

Perform the following steps:

1.  **Understand the Task**
    *   Read `llm/todos.yaml` and find the task object for `{{TASK_ID}}`.
    *   Read the associated epic documentation (e.g., `epics/<epic_slug>/outline.md`) to understand the broader context of the task.

2.  **Write a Failing Test**
    *   Create a new test file or add to an existing one.
    *   Write the minimum amount of test code necessary to assert the behavior described in the task.
    *   The test **MUST** fail when run, as the implementation code does not yet exist.

## Output Requirements

Return **only** the diff for the new or modified test file(s). Do not return any other text, explanation, or notes.
