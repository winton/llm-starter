# Prompt 02 â€“ Feature Implementation Loop

SYSTEM:
You are a senior full-stack engineer who is an expert in agile development, test-driven development (TDD), and shipping high-quality, end-to-end features.

USER:
Our high-level feature plan lives in `docs/EPICS.md`.
Each time this prompt is executed, perform **exactly one atomic cycle** of the feature implementation loop below.

---

## Feature Implementation Loop

1.  **Select Epic**
    *   Load `docs/EPICS.md` and `TODOs.md`.
    *   Find the first epic in `docs/EPICS.md` that is not yet marked as `completed` in `TODOs.md`. This is the **current epic**.
    *   If all epics are complete, return the text `All features complete :tada:`.

2.  **Document the Slice**
    *   If documentation for the current epic doesn't exist, create it. For example, if the epic is "User Authentication", create `docs/features/user_authentication.md`.
    *   The documentation should be just detailed enough for an engineer to build the feature. Include user stories, API endpoints, and data models if applicable.

3.  **Generate Slice Backlog**
    *   Break down the epic's documentation into a small, ordered list of engineering tasks (TODOs).
    *   Append these tasks to `TODOs.md` at the project root.
    *   Each TODO **MUST** have a stable `id` and can have a `depends_on` key:
        `Implement user API [id=API-1, priority=high, epic=auth, depends_on=DB-4]`
    *   If the epic's tasks already exist in `TODOs.md`, proceed to the next step.

4.  **Implement the Slice (TDD Cycle)**
    *   From the epic's tasks in `TODOs.md`, select the highest-priority incomplete task **that has no incomplete dependencies**.
    *   **Test first:** Write a failing test for the task.
    *   **Implement:** Write the minimum code to make the test pass.
    *   **Verify:** Run all quality gates. **Read the specific shell commands for the `test`, `lint`, `format`, `type_check`, and `security_scan` gates from `llm.config.yaml`**.
    *   If gates fail, attempt to fix. After **4** failed attempts:
        a. Mark the TODO as `blocked` in `TODOs.md`.
        b. Create `REVIEW_REQUESTED.md` with the TODO, the failing diff, and error logs.
        c. **Stop** and wait for human review.
    *   **Refactor (optional):** If the implementation is clumsy, you may perform a small refactor while keeping all tests green.
    *   Update `TODOs.md`: mark the task as `completed`.

5.  **Stop**
    *   End this run after completing one TDD cycle for a single task. The next run will pick up the next task for the same epic, or the next epic if all tasks for the current one are done.

## Output Requirements

Return **only one** of the following:

1.  The diff / code edits produced during this run.
2.  The content of a newly created documentation or `REVIEW_REQUESTED.md` file.
3.  The text `All features complete :tada:` if all epics are implemented.
