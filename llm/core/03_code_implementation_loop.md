# Prompt 03 – Code Implementation Loop

SYSTEM:
You are a senior software engineer, test-driven development evangelist, and master of small, incremental changes.

USER:
Our documentation is finished and the engineering backlog lives in `TODOs.md` at the repository root.
Each time this prompt is executed, perform **exactly one atomic cycle** of the implementation loop below.

---

## Implementation Loop Algorithm

0. **Consult knowledge base**  
   * Load `knowledge/DECISIONS.md` (create if absent) to recall past architectural decisions.

1. **Load the backlog**  
   * Parse `TODOs.md`, including each item's metadata block (`priority`, `area`, `estimate`, `labels`).  
   * Select the **highest-value** TODO using this precedence: higher `priority` → smaller `estimate` → oldest entry.

2. **Plan the task**
   * Restate the selected TODO in your own words.
   * If the TODO is large, break it into sub-tasks (sub-todos) that can be completed within a few minutes of LLM time.

3. **Test first**
   * For the *current* sub-task, create or update an appropriate test file inside the `tests/` directory.
   * Ensure the new test fails because the feature/bug-fix is not yet implemented.

4. **Implement**
   * Modify the codebase to satisfy the failing test using the minimal change that works (red → green).
   * Adhere to project standards and keep changes focused.

5. **Verify & Quality Gates**  
   * Run the entire test suite **and** static analysis tools: linter, formatter, type-checker, and security scan.  
   * All gates must pass. If any gate fails, attempt to fix and rerun. After **4** consecutive failed repair attempts, mark the TODO as `blocked` and ask for human assistance (no git operations).

6. **Doc sync**  
   * Compare the current implementation with the documentation. If discrepancies exist, append a documentation TODO (with suitable metadata) to `TODOs.md`.

7. **Refactor (optional)**  
   * If the implementation introduced duplication or complexity, perform safe refactors while keeping all quality gates green.

8. **Update backlog**  
   * If all sub-tasks for the TODO are complete, mark the parent TODO as `completed`.  
   * Otherwise, append the remaining sub-tasks under the TODO item.  
   * Do **not** delete uncommitted files or files with pending changes without explicit user permission.

9. **Stop**  
   * End this run **after** finishing the current sub-task or TODO (whichever is smaller).  
   * If the loop aborted due to unmet gates after 4 attempts, ensure the TODO is flagged `blocked`.

## Output Requirements

When this prompt finishes, return **only one** of the following:

1. The diff / code edits produced during this run (preferred in tool-use IDEs).
2. The exact text `Implementation complete :tada:` if **all** TODO items are now `completed`.

Do not add any further commentary outside the required output.
